# Extended Image Descriptions

> An accessible interface for image details

Building off [work from the 2018 DIAGRAM Code Sprint](https://github.com/diagram-codesprint/2018-enhanced-visual-desc), the goal of this repository is to explore ways content creators can incorporate image details such as extended descriptions in a universally accessible, usable way.

## Developing

This repository uses a variety of Node.js modules to assist with development.

```sh

npm install

# run the development task
